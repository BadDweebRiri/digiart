  <h1>Welcome to my Digital Art</h1>
  <p>You can download these for free. Donations for my efforts are GREATLY appreciated but NOT required! Honestly, truly, not required.
    Enjoy these freely: make stickers, cards, stick them in your clear phone case (I do), print them as polaroids.
    I use walgreens to print and then send snail mail to my friends.
    If you want to brighten someone's day, I cannot recommend it ENOUGH ! You know... sending snail mail.
    I can also send one of my prints via snail mail on behalf of you, to any of your friends/loved ones, with any message you like. It will be hand written.
    So if your name is Alex, the note will begin with "Here is a message from someone who adores you, Alex." Something like that. Please use the link below to purchase this for $1. (postage + print costs)

    MESSAGE ME DETAILS OF YOUR MESSAGE. 
    
    All donations will go to my school tuition.</p>
